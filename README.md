# Model-Evaluation
Model Evaluation is a crucial step in the machine learning (ML) workflow. It tells you how well your model is performing on unseen data and helps you decide whether it's ready for deployment or needs improvement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Evaluate Models?
- Measure Performance: Quantify how well a model performs using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- Compare Models: Determine which algorithm or set of hyperparameters delivers the best results.
- Detect Overfitting/Underfitting: Assess whether the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- Optimize Resources: Prevent the deployment of poorly performing models, saving time and computational resources.
