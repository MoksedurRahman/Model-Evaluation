# Model-Evaluation
Model Evaluation is a crucial step in the machine learning (ML) workflow. It tells you how well your model is performing on unseen data and helps you decide whether it's ready for deployment or needs improvement.

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Model Evaluation
- Measure accuracy of predictions.

- Detect overfitting or underfitting.

- Compare different models or algorithms.

- Tune hyperparameters effectively.
